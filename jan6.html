        <p>In this day in history, we see a large-scale attack and destruction of the U.S. Capitol building. In this photo, we can see a man stealing a podium with the seal of the Speaker of the House on it. I feel sorry for the future APUSH students who will need to respond to a DBQ about this picture.</p>
